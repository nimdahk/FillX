FillX
=====

Realtime intelligent window resizing for the X Window System

Usage
=====
Using your system's keyboard settings to set up a hotkey to launch FillX is recommended. Once it's running, click on a
window, then move your mouse to where you want the window to go. Pressing Alt will change whether the script maximizes
height or width. Click again to finalize.

Installation
------------
FillX requires Python 2.7 and Python-Xlib. If xwininfo is installed, FillX will use that for window selection; otherwise,
the active window will be used.




"FillX" is a play on the phrase "fill in," the opposite of "in" being "ex," and the name of the Linux window system, X.

Just not a very clever one.
